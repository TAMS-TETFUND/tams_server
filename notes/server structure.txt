The TAMS server is supposed to be responsible for:
    -   being the aggregation point and primary source of truth for all
        student/staff registration data.
    -   It should provide an interface for synching all necessary information 
        required for a new node device to work.
    -   It should also have an archive for attendance data to preserve it long 
        after they were logged and discarded by node devices.

===================================for synching between node device and server================================
    - an api should exist on the server for any data that will be required by the node device (attendance, course
        registration, student biodata, staff biodata)
    - the interface on hte node device should have a feature for connecting to the server for several operations.
        this feature should be only accessible to staff with appropriate permissions to it.
