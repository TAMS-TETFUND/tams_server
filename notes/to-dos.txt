===================================project's big tasks========================================================
    = camera issue - implementing threading significantly improved performance: (may also look at multiprocessing)
    = on-screen keypad  - done
    = fingerprint test : catch exception blocking the gui when fprint scanner is not connected -done
    = node device hotspot implementation to enable users download attendance immediately
    = keypad feature implementation
    = attendance sign-out feature for events
    = csv preparation for populating db tables
    = server frontend
    = project security & logging
    = communication layer implementation
    = data synching
    = testing the face-recognition feature in different lighting to ascertain optimal conditions for 
        its usage. There is a jitter attribute capture of the registration image that could be tweaked
        to see if the accuracy of the feature will improve in different lighting conditions.
==================issues=====================================================================
    = the network setup window on the node device assumes that a keyboard is available
        on the node device. There maybe need to implement a compact keypad with  all characters
        available.
=====================server frontend=========================================================
Features:
= attendance list generation on a per class, per department, per faculty basis.

=============================
If analytics for course attendance is created, who is allowed to 
view it?
    = All staff in the department?
    = All staff that are assigned to teach the course?
    = There should be a per-session course allocation model that
        maintains the allocation of courses to staff.
    = An exam officer should have access to the attendance metric
    = There should be a collated attendance sheet that breaks down all
        attendance for a particular course (Total number of lectures
        in a given session and how many each student attended with 
        the percentage attendance percentage)
